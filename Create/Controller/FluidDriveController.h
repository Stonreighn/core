 *  FluidDriveController.h
 *
 *  The Fluid Drive Controller is further development of the Block Drive Controller.
 *  It supports control of the robot with a two-dimensional GUI joystick. The
 *  Controller has two yokes, yokeX and yokeY which accept values between -1
 *  and 0. The speed of the robot is determined by the yokeY value, while the
 *  direction of the robotï¿½s movement is set by the yokeX value. The disadvantage
 *  of this controller is that rotations around the center axis of the robot are
 *  not supported due to the nature of the joystick.
